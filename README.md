# Iconic Button

Button that can receive an icon as label with or without text.

## Description

Modern websites need the ability to show buttons with text and icons or only icons.
This is not easy to accomplish with the core/button especially not for users.
The Iconic Button gives the user an easy way to create buttons with icons and or text.
The design is kept close to the core button for leaving the underlying the design unchanged.

The Iconic Button is considered for modern FSE themes, that uses theme.json for defining
colors and gradients as well as layouts.

Like the core/button the Iconic Button is added inside a parent container that is added to
the inserter and called "icon buttons". Inside an icon button can be added by clicking the
plus at the right end.
This creates th default style "fill" a button. Colors, icons, border radius and variant can
be adapted in the sidebar. A link will be added using the toolbar of the block.
